## Background Information:
If you're reading this, then Hi! My name is Brianna Peralta, and throughout my 4 Year Stay at **[HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/)**, or **High School of Telecommunication, Arts, and Technology**, I have been apart of a special program called **SEP**, which is also known as the **[Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/)**. SEP, at least the 10th Grade Variation, dives into Introducing Necessary Tools such as **[Github](https://github.com/)**, **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**, and what's known as an **[IDE](https://cs50.dev/)**, which stands for **Integrated Development Environment.** Learning about these tools, as well as the content in the 5 Units, prepared us for a final project which is called the **Freedom Project**. The Freedom Project might sound foreign, but don't worry; I'll explain what it is.

## What is the Freedom Project? 
The Freedom Project is a course long project assigned to every student who has chosen to attend SEP. The premise is simple; Research a Topic you enjoy, and depending on the Course you are taking, you will have to create and present your final results. For those in SEP10, their Freedom Project is based around Websites. Their project is to create a functional website that displays at least **2** Components learned from Bootstrap, as well as the research you should have gotten a bit earlier into the school year. You were also required to use an additional tool in order to help you code. For my Project, I decided to choose **Writing** as a topic, since the topic itself is very personal to me and where I come from, and for the additional tool, I chose to study and use  **[Animate CSS](https://animate.style/)**, as I thought it'd make the project more interesting. Using those 2 Selections, as well as knowledge from HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Github, the Website was created and now it's free to be displayed.

### Blogs:
Throughout the Freedom Project, we were told to write Blogs, which documented the steps taken towards the final results. These Blogs admittedly are pretty long, and while I do apologize for that, I'd also like to say that they are this long in order to give life to the struggles and achievements I've made along the way. There are 10 Blogs in total, and they are in numerical order below this short paragraph.
