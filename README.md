## Background Information:
* If you're reading this, then Hi! My name is Brianna Peralta, and throughout my 4 Year Stay at **[HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/)**, or **High School of Telecommunication, Arts, and Technology**, I have been apart of a special program called **SEP**, which is also known as the **[Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/)**. SEP, at least the 10th Grade Variation, dives into Introducing Necessary Tools such as **[Github](https://github.com/)**, **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**, and what's known as an **[IDE](https://cs50.dev/)**, which stands for **Integrated Development Environment.** Learning about these tools, as well as the content in the 5 Units, prepared us for a final project which is called the **Freedom Project**. 

## What is the Freedom Project? 
For my project, I chose the topic of **Writing**.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **[Animate CSS](https://animate.style/)** in order to help me make my website.
