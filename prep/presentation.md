# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Start with a question:
  * "What tends to motivate the human mind the most?" "What is claimed to make the World go round?"
* Propose a problem to the crowd:
  * "Not a lot of people would want to do big tasks without incentives. Let's say you are tasked with writing a 4 Page essay for someone. They won't pay you, or give any reward. Would you still write the essay?"
* Gauge the Crowd's Reactions, then propose a solution:
  * "If so.. What if the person tasked you to write the essay, but while using this?"
## Product
* Introduce T.I.P.S (The Imaginative Pen for Scholars):
 * Briefly mention it's features, and the money gimmick.
* Introduce the Website soon after:
 * "All of this information, as well as what I've used to gather it can be found here!"
## Process
* Go over the Thought Process behind T.I.P.S:
 * "T.I.P.S was an idea I had forming in my head since I wanted to talk about writing.."
* Connect the Website to T.I.P.S:
 * "Because of T.I.P.S, I was inspired to do some further thinking.." 
* Bring up the `Carousel Strand`:
 * "While creating the Website, I felt stuck, and as if I wouldn't be able to produce it and T.I.P.S on time, but.. There's this one strand of code that not only helped me complete a section, but also encourage me to continue on. I call it the Carousel Strand.."
* Show the `Carousel Strand` and Explain its Impact:
 
  <div class="container">
   <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-5">

## Conclusion
* Give a brief recap of the Production Experience:
 * "Writing and Planning everything was an absolute roller coaster.."
* Briefly Revisit Inspirations and Takeaways:
 * "With the experience now being over, I plan to look back at it with fondness, and with the Carousel Strand in mind. With a bit of encouragement, you could literally do anything: Take me and the Carousel Strand as proof."
* Revisit Proposed Question from before, but while bringing up T.I.P.S:
 * "Now with everything said.. Would you want to write that 4 Page Essay, but while using T.I.P.S?"
* Thank the Crowd, before displaying an URL to the Website.
<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
