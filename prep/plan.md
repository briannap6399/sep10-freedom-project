## Timeline

### Monday:
* Work on the beginning of the website by coding in a navbar, and setting up *'Default Connect-Links'*. (Default Connect-Links is my word for prototype headings.)
### Tuesday:
* Start Progress on the Overview Section; Use Containers to make it it's own box, with some internal boxes for images of different pens and utensils, as well as the background context of the website. If there is enough time, work on the carousel and Writing History Section of the Website using a similar contrainer strategy.
### Wendnesday-Thursday:
* Cannot make Progress; Camping Trip.
### Friday:
* Continue work on the Writing History, and if completed, move to work on the TIPS Section, following a similar structure as the previous 2 sections. (Also make sure to add in the rotating image.)
### Saturday:
* Add in the Contacts Section if the TIPS Section is complete, and start adding in adaptable features.
### Sunday:
* Finish anything you have left to complete.

#### Beyond MVP

[] Go through a big revamp. Creating from scratch is clearly not helping you, so get a bootstrap template and use it.
[] Possibly try to replace some of the cards with the carousel, and change around the colors to fit the color palette you wanted.
