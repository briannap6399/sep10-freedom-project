Before we start, consider this: If you were given a job to hammer in a nail, and you prepared to do said job with a balloon animal, would you be able to complete the job? It could be done, I won't lie, but would it be difficult? Absolutely. As stated in the last blog entry, our progess on the Freedom Project relied on us tnkering, and eventually, learning a tool we selected. I've already said that I've chosen to use and learn [Animate CSS,](https://animate.style/) and I did mention what I wanted to do with Animate CSS, (Make a 2-D ['Word Cloud'](https://boostlabs.com/what-are-word-clouds-value-simple-visualizations/) with Animated Segments of HTML Code) but I truly cannot explain the struggle I had went through in order to even make this possible! I'll get more into the struggle later, but know that for Animate CSS, I had learned many things; I Learned how to use unique classes, such as `animate__faster` and `animate__repeat-3`, as well as unique CSS Variables, which when combined with a class, can either Speed-Up/Slow Down your animation even more, or make it repeat several more times! I feel like this image will paint a good representation as to what I mean:
