# Entry 5: Tool Learning

Before we start, consider this: If you were given a job to hammer in a nail, and you prepared to do said job with a balloon animal, would you be able to complete the job? It could be done, I won't lie, but would it be difficult? Absolutely. As stated in the last blog entry, our progess on the Freedom Project relied on us tnkering, and eventually, learning a tool we selected. I've already said that I've chosen to use and learn [Animate CSS,](https://animate.style/) and I did mention what I wanted to do with Animate CSS, (Make a 2-D ['Word Cloud'](https://boostlabs.com/what-are-word-clouds-value-simple-visualizations/) with Animated Segments of HTML Code) but I truly cannot explain the struggle I had went through in order to even make this possible! I'll get more into the struggle later, but know that for Animate CSS, I genuinely learned quite a bit. There are these unique classes that I learned how to use, such as `animate__faster` and `animate__repeat-3`, as well as unique CSS Variables, which when combined with a class, can either Speed-Up/Slow Down your animation even more, or make it repeat several more times! I feel like this screenshot will give you more information than I have given right now:

The screenshot actually comes from a [Learning Log](../tool/learning-log.md) that I created in order to look back at what I learned from Animate CSS. For the most part, I've updated it weekly, and it's been a great help in recollecting my thoughts. 

## Thought-Out Plan & EDP: 
Just like Blog 4, I feel the need to combine these 2 portions together once more, mainly due to how deeply rooted both portions are together. Anyways,
