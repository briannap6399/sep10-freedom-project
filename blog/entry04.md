## Content: 
We're finally in the big year of 2025, but that does not mean we're slowing down one bit. As soon as we finished finalizing our content, (look in [entry 3](entry03.md) for that) we started researching special Tools that we plan to use on our webpages. In terms that relate to SEP, Tools are essential small websites, of course relating to Computer Science, that offers some additional knowledge on a topic, such as using CSS to animate words, or using written HTML in order to create 3-D Objects. It sounds cool, and in all honesty, it really is. However, we are only limited to using 1 Webpage, in order to maximize what we learn from it. To do this, we were instructed to spend some time tinkering and playing with small aspects of a few websites, in order to get a feel of them, and by the end of our tinkering, we had to choose which website we wanted to move forward with. Then of course, we'd document it here as an entry, hence why I have this finished blog entry. So that now begs the question: *"Bri. Which Website did you end up choosing to focus more on?"* After a few days of thinking it over, and of course a bit of time tinkering with some websites, I think I have my definitive answer. But before we get into that, please note that I genuinely had fun tinkering with 2 out of the 3 Websites I had in my top 3, and while I admit I didn't focus that much on that 3rd Website, I still wish to look into it; Maybe not for SEP, but on my own time. But Regardless, my top 3 Websites were as followed:

* ### [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)
* ### [Animate CSS](https://animate.style/)
* ### [J-Query](https://jquery.com/)
