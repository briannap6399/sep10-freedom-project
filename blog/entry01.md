## Content: 
  Throughout the start of SEP (Software Engineering Program), we were tasked on selecting a topic to preform a "Freedom Project" on. Our teacher, Mr. Mueller, recommended that we picked a topic in particular that we enjoy; it could be anything, as long as it didn't already link to Technology. I had to juggle between 3 different topics in order to pick the one I'd eventually end up with, those being either **Education, Photography, or Writing**. I initally would've picked **Photography**, however, I felt as if it was too close to Technology already. A lot of the current innovations for it already have a few ties to Technology, so.. I decided to scrap it. That left **Education** and **Writing**. While **Edcation** could be more easy to talk about, in the end I decided to base my project on **Writing**. I feel that I am a lot stronger at writing than I even realized, and this topic helps me feel comfortable in my own body, mainly because I can't fnd the proper words to speak on my emotions, but with **Writing**, I am able to openly say them. That's why my topic for my SEP Freedom Project will be **Writing**.

  Now that I confirmed that **Writing** will be my topic, I had to think about what sources I would use to accurately get the previous innovations in the Writing Field. Thankfully, I already have a few that I plan to use.
