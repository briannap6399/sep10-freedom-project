# Entry 1: Topic Selections

## Content: 
  Throughout the start of SEP (Software Engineering Program), we were tasked on selecting a topic to preform a "Freedom Project" on. Our teacher, Mr. Mueller, recommended that we picked a topic in particular that we enjoy; it could be anything, as long as it didn't already link to Technology. I had to juggle between 3 different topics in order to pick the one I'd eventually end up with, those being either **Education, Photography, or Writing**. I initally would've picked **Photography**, however, I felt as if it was too close to Technology already. A lot of the current innovations for it already have a few ties to Technology, so.. I decided to scrap it. That left **Education** and **Writing**. While **Edcation** could be more easy to talk about, in the end I decided to base my project on **Writing**. I feel that I am a lot stronger at writing than I even realized, and this topic helps me feel comfortable in my own body, mainly because I can't fnd the proper words to speak on my emotions, but with **Writing**, I am able to openly say them. That's why my topic for my SEP Freedom Project will be **Writing**.

  Now that I confirmed that **Writing** will be my topic, I had to think about what sources I would use to accurately get the previous innovations in the Writing Field. Thankfully, I already have a few that I plan to use. For Example, I plan to use ["The Evolution of Writing"](https://sites.utexas.edu/dsb/tokens/the-evolution-of-writing/) by The University of Texas, ["Techonolgies of Writing"](https://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/2006/technologies-of-writing) by the Harry Ransom Center, and ["The Typewriter: An Innovation in Writing"](https://www.sfomuseum.org/exhibitions/typewriter-innovation-writing) by the SFO Museum. While I will be using more sources, these 3 I plan to use especially.

## The Engineering Design Process: 
  While considering what I'll be talking about in my website, I was also thinking about what current inventions for **Writing**. I recall how we have Typewriters, Various Stationery, even Apps dedicated for **Writing**. This is amazing progress for the topic, however, I realized that as of recent years, fewer and fewer people are choosing to write. Instead, people have been choosing to rely on sources such as ChatGPT for essays, and projects, all without studying the topic and putting in the passion that Artifical Intelligence has. With that said, I was considering trying to come up with an unique device that not only aids in writing more complex stories and articles, but also have it feel rewarding to the writer. For now though, this is merely a W.I.P (Work in Progress). 

## Neccessary Skills:
  In order to accomplish anything with my website, I would not only need to put in the proper research, but also consider what skills I'd need, or even need to improve, in order to continue on smoothly. For this, I currently have 3 Skills in mind, those being **Time-Managing**, **Advanced Researching**, and most important of all, **Flexbility**. These might be a little weird right now, but if I were to explain what I mean by these 3 Skills, then things will be more smooth.
