# Entry 3: Brainstorming and Content Finalizing
#### Brianna Peralta on December 18th, 2024 (12/18/24)

## Content:
It has honestly been a wild ride since the 2nd Blog Entry was posted. Since November 6th, (The day I started working on Blog 2) we had now started to finalize the research we had been doing to our respective topics, and instead, started brainstorming a theoretical *Future Innovation*, which if everything is planned correctly, would help progress the future of.. Whatever we wanted to talk about. As I've said repeatedly, the topic I selected for this year-long project happened to be none other than **Writing**. I also had a question I wanted to think about while coming up with the theoretical Innovation, which in all honesty, helped me better plan out what my Innovation should be. The question was none other than this: *'How would my Future Innovation encourage teenagers, like myself, to write more than they do now?'* Nevertheless, the idea was made, but more on that in the next portion of the blog. What I do want to talk about, however, is a problem that has shown its head while finalizing my content. I admit, I took a lot of useless information from various sites that, while related to my topic, didn't have exactly what I needed. Upon the past few days, I went over all of my information, which mind you, was supposed to be organized, and realized it wasn't exactly as organized as I really wanted. Since I was including information about *Past Writing Innovations*, I decided that the best course of action, at least in my case, would be to re-organize everything into a timeline. I had searched through what I had, deleted a lot of useless bits of information, (Since it talked about reviews of the Innovations I already had), added more or re-wrote what I was going to say about specific Innovations, and then re-organized what remained in **Chronological Order**. In the end of what I like to call *"The Info Purge"*, I ended up being left with what I now feel extremely confident in. It's currently in what is rightfully deemed [*"The Finalized Content"*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14lCXmqGjd6fZM-5DlwLMHV1BOZUfh_nCqYJNnf4n0Pw/edit), but incase no one else but myself can see the document on their own accord, this is what the timeline now looks like: 

 * ## Before Common Era (BCE): [(The Evolution of Writing,](https://sites.utexas.edu/dsb/tokens/the-evolution-of-writing/) [The Phoenician Alphabet)](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-artifacts/inscriptions/the-phoenician-alphabet-in-archaeology/)
    * ### 9000-3100 BCE
        * Tokens were used as the initial writing device, where they commonly took the shapes of circles, or cones. They were used to keep track of various stocked goods, as well as trades amongst other people. They commonly used symbols to communicate however, instead of the modern day method of words.
          * [Link to Writing Token(s) Image](https://jtwceramics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tokens_incised-1.jpg) 
    * ### 3000 BCE 
        * Logograms were used as a means of communication around 3000 BC. They took similar ideas of the writing token, where they’d use symbols to communicate certain topics. Think Egyptian Hieroglyphics, and the 
          modern day Dollar Sign as examples of Logograms. 
    * ### 1050 BCE 
        * The Phoenician Abjad would be created by this time, and is credited as the inspiration for future alphabets. It had about 21 characters, with each of them alone being used to represent a word. For example, our modern day 'N' was called Nun, and meant fish.
          * [Link to Phoenician Abjad Image](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nora-stone.jpg)
  *  ## Common Era (CE): [(Age of Print Innovations,](https://folgerpedia.folger.edu/Technologies_of_Writing_in_the_Age_of_Print) [Google Docs History,](https://blog.google/products/docs/happy-15-years-google-docs/) [History of the Fountain Pen](https://loclen.com/en-us/blogs/fountain-pens/the-fascinating-history-of-fountain-pens?srsltid=AfmBOoppLA3m9iFkpsYoIJlzWNKuSlfgKnQ-tG0I2EKfrzsmIkS-j90G) [History of the Typewriter,](https://www.britannica.com/technology/typewriter) [Technologies of Writing,](https://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/2006/technologies-of-writing/) [The Evolution of the Kobo eReader)](https://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/the-evolution-of-the-kobo-e-reader-in-pictures)
     * ### 1662 CE
       * Graphite Pencils, one of the first of its kind, was originally named Black Lead Pencils. They were originally used by artists to create quick sketches, before moving to the Modern Day usage we currently see and use them for.
          * [Link to Graphite Pencil Image](https://www.marinersmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1889-59-1-Pencil.jpg)
     * ### 1827-1884 CE 
       * Approximately in 1867, the first edition of the typewriter was created, which was a machine dedicated to typing long                   sequences of sentences within moments. They required patience and delicacy, as one could easily mess up an entire paper by             accident with one mis-click.
          * [Link to Typewriter Image](https://site.xavier.edu/polt/typewriters/caligraph-small.jpg) 
       * By 1884, Fountain Pens would also start to appear. They are special pens with metal nibs at the tip, and use water based               inks.Those with these kinds of pens were credited with excellent penmanship, and they are commonly used in arts such as                calligraphy.

     * ### 1938 CE
        * By now, the Xerographic Copier was created. It’s a system that took graphic matter, and copied it on a photoconductive                 insulating surface. The paper it used to do this was smoother, and perfect to hold the necessary inks of any typed documents.
     * ### 2006 CE
        * Google Docs, a digital source of writing documents, was originally called Writely in 2005, is still widely used today by               businesses and scholars, after its immense amount of updates, including allowing other scholars/business associates to                 edit and watch over a document. 
     * ### 2009-2010 CE
        * The Kobo eReader and Kobowriter are devices that were created with the help of Github, a website dedicated to working with             businesses and classes in the creation of various softwares. These products would skillfully replicate the fonts found on              paper documents, and the typical feel of simply writing a book.

I am so grateful I was able to pull off the timeline, as it took me a lot of trial, error, and especially research. With that said, however, perhaps now I should move onto the next portions.

## EDP (Engineering Design Process)
If I were to look back at the [current EDP Chart](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/), I would say that I'm currently in the midst of the 3rd and 4th Phase, which of course, happen to be **Brainstorm Possible Solutions** and **Plan the Most Promising Solution** respectively. As said previously in the Context portion of the blog, I wanted to come up with an idea that would somehow make Writing interesting for Teenagers, and have them be rewarded for doing it. I recall once participating in an event in my old Elementary School, where students would jump rope for 10 minutes straight, and with every jump they were able to successfully complete, they would generate money that would go to school funds. It had me thinking of using money as the incentive, but how would someone be paid? After more thinking, I decided this: *'What if every word written gives the person 20 Cents, in either a currently existing bank account, or in a weekly check that would come in the mail?'* In my mind, I thought it was perfect! It did fit what I wanted the Innovation to do, and it established a viable way to obtain the money! As I got deeper into the design process, I decided to make the Innovation take the shape of a pencil, seeing how it's designed for writing, and include a way for the device to speak back to the writer, allowing them to hear how their sentences would sound when read aloud. Upon finalizing the creation, I decided to name it **T.I.P.S**, which happens to stand for **T**he **I**maginative **P**encil for **S**cholars. Just like the timeline in the context portion, I will also be posting the finished innovation in [*"The Finalized Content"*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14lCXmqGjd6fZM-5DlwLMHV1BOZUfh_nCqYJNnf4n0Pw/edit), but in case it's not reachable, here is the innovation: 

   ## The Imaginative Pencil for Scholars (T.I.P.S.)
   
   * Allows the user to write along most flat surfaces, including leaves and rocks.
      * Detects if it’s used on private property (School Walls, Desks,etc) and won’t work.
   * 2 Main-Line Battery Sources. (Battery, and Friction, aka using your hands to generate energy)
      * Battery is Primary, and runs on 1 Triple A.
      * For Friction, you’d need to aggressively rub your hands against the pencil’s grippers. 
        * It’d take 1 minute of rubbing to generate enough energy to use the pen once again.
   * Reads back what you wrote to you.
      * Possible AI Voice Customization. 
      * Can change the language that’s used (To make it accessible to any Non-English Speakers)
        * Is also compatible to write in foreign languages. 
   * Pays the user 20 Cents for every word they write with said pencil. 
      * Has the option to link to a currently existing credit card, or can come with a newer credit card.
      * Could also come in as a weekly check.
  * Uses Biodegradable Inks to generate different word colors, and fonts.
      * Specific Color Palettes can also be customized, and used for different articles of writing. (Manuscripts, Reports, Fictional           Novels, etc)
      * Ink comes from natural items, such as trees, bugs, plants and flowers.

I hope that as I get further into the development of **T.I.P.S**, the innovation will come together in the way I always hoped it would be. With that said however, onto the next portion of the blog.

### Skills Progress:
It seems that for every blog I work on, I will always update on the skills that I had initially written for the first blog. I honestly think this is a good thing, since it gives me the possibility of looking back with the same requirements in mind, and helps me evaluate how I've been doing on a specific skill. Anyways, I'd say that all 3 Skills have thankfully seen improvement as of writing Blog 2. However, I don't have that much to say for **Advanced Researching** and **Flexibility**, so their respective progress updates will be brief. However, **Time Management** will have a lot more than those two, so warnings in advance.

#### Advanced Researching
Since I had to do a lot of research once again, I can definitely recall points in time where I had to dig deeper, and use more specific vocabulary to finally get what I need. A prime example would be with the *Fountain Pen*, as I kept finding articles and websites that only talked about what the pen was. Instead of using *'How Old is the FOuntain Pen?'*, or '*What was the Fountain Pen used for?'*, I started to ask a few questions that relate more to the pen's history: '*Who created the Fountain Pen?'*, and *'What is the history behind the Fountain Pen'* were just some of the few questions I asked to get more than enough information.

#### Flexibility:
As time had started to run out for finalizing my content, I started to realize that I was just short of what I wanted thanks to *"The Info Purge"*. This was also the point in time I realized that, while yes Google Docs is well known, people only talk about its writing components, and not its collaborating possibilities. I decided to be more lenient on what I wanted to find, and eventually stumbled across the perfect websites that talked about Google Docs, which ironically enough, came from the company, Google, itself. 

#### Time Management:
Time for the heavy hitter, Time Management. While I still regret not being able to find accurate and enough information, my accident had given me the perfect time to plan out my next moves: I decided to split my time into 3 different categories: 3 Hours should be used finding the information I needed, about an hour should be used getting necessary images, and any remaining time should go into finalizing my content. It took me a long while to do all 3, as I kept changing and adding in new information, as well as finding more unique ways to get the images. As you, the reader, can clearly see with the fact I was able to finish this, I was able to finish everything I wanted to finish in the given time, and I was even left with enough time to do smaller updates, which is honestly, proof that I've finally seen the changes I wanted to see.

Overall, I am so happy with the improvements I've been making with my targeted skills. That's not to say that I'll outright try to stop improving. It's the opposite really. I now feel further encouraged to try and improve much further than I have, as this will be good for not just my project, but for any aspiring goals I have in the future!

### Conclusions and Goals:
That brings us to the end of the blog! Despite the fact that the Innovation Creation portion of the Freedom Project is now over, I still feel more than excited for what I'll be working on in the near future. This will be the last time that I write a blog before 2025 strikes, which just leaves me with even more excitement. What will next year be like? Will my desires and admirations change? Or even, will I start further planning the color palette of my website? Admittedly, I have an answer for only 1 of these questions. I do have a palette in mind, which will mainly be mixes of black, off-white, grey, and purple. Things will be changed however, if I recognize that the colors don't align as much as I want them to. Regardless, I will be using this time to make color palettes, and I will happily show images of these palettes soon. With that said, thank you for reading, and take care!
