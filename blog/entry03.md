# Entry 3: Brainstorming and Content Finalizing
#### Brianna Peralta on December 18th, 2024 (12/18/24)

## Content:
It has honestly been a wild ride since the 2nd Blog Entry had been posted. Since November 6th, (The day I started working on Blog 2) we had now started to finalize the research we had been doing to our respective topics, and instead, started brainstorming a theoretical *Future Innovation*, which if everything is planned correctly, would help progress the future of.. Whatever we wanted to talk about. As I've said repeatedly, the topic I selected for this year-long project happened to be none other than **Writing**. I also had a question I wanted to think about while coming up with the theoretical Innovation, which in all honestly, helped me better plan out what my Innovation should be. The question was noneother than this: *'How would my Future Innovation encourage teenagers, like myself, to write more than they do now?'* Nevertheless, the idea was made, but more on that in the next portion of the blog. What I do want to talk about, however, is a problem that had occured while finalizing my content. I admit, I took a lot of useless information from various sites that, while related to my topic, didn't have exactly what I needed. Upon the past few days, I went over all of my information, which mind you, was supposed to be organized, and realized it wasn't exactly as organized as I really wanted. Since I was including information about *Past Writing Innovations*, I decided that the best course of action, at least in my case, would be to re-organize everything into a timeline. I had searched through what I had, deleted a lot of useless bits of information, (Since it talked about reviews of the Innovations I already had), added more or re-wrote what I was going to say about specific Innovations, and then re-organized what remained in **Chronological Order**. In the end of what I like to call *"The Info Purge"*, I ended up being left with what I now feel extremely confident in. It's currently in what is rightfully deemed [*"The Finalized Content"*](#), but incase no one else but myself can see the document on their own occord, this is what the timeline now looks like: 

* Writing History: (Part A)
  * ## Before Common Era (BCE): (The Evolution of Writing, The Phoenician Alphabet) 
    * 9000-3100 BCE
        * Tokens were used as the initial writing device, where they commonly took the shapes of circles, or cones. They were used to keep track of various stocked goods, as well as trades amongst other people. They           commonly used symbols to communicate however, instead of the modern day method of words.

    * 3000 BCE 
        * Logograms were used as a means of communication around 3000 BC. They took similar ideas of the writing token, where they’d use symbols to communicate certain topics. Think Egyptian Hieroglyphics, and the 
          modern day Dollar Sign as examples of Logograms. 
    * 1050 BCE 
        * The Phoenician Abjad would be created by this time, and is credited as the inspiration for future alphabets. It had about 21 characters, with each of them alone being used to represent a word. For example,           our modern day N was called Nun, and meant fish.

  *  ## Common Era (CE): (Age of Print Innovations, Google Docs History, 		 History of the Fountain Pen, History of the Typewriter, Technologies of Writing, The Evolution of the Kobo eReader)
    * 1662 CE
      * Graphite Pencils, one of the first of its kind, was originally named Black Lead Pencils. They were originally used by artists to create quick sketches, before moving to the Modern Day usage we currently see         and use them for. (Link to Graphite Pencil Image)
    * 1827-1884 CE 
Approximately in 1867, the first edition of the typewriter was created, which was a machine dedicated to typing long sequences of sentences within moments. They required patience and delicacy, as one could easily mess up an entire paper by accident with one mis-click.

By 1884, Fountain Pens would also start to appear. They are special pens with metal nibs at the tip, and use water based inks. Those with these kinds of pens were credited with excellent penmanship, and they are commonly used in arts such as calligraphy.

1938 CE
By now, the Xerographic Copier was created. It’s a system that took graphic matter, and copied it on a photoconductive insulating surface. The paper it used to do this was smoother, and perfect to hold the necessary inks of any typed documents.
2006 CE
Google Docs, a digital source of writing documents, was originally called Writely in 2005, is still widely used today by businesses and scholars, after its immense amount of updates, including allowing other scholars/business associates to edit and watch over a document. 
2009-2010 CE
The Kobo eReader and Kobowriter are devices that were created with the help of Github, a website dedicated to working with businesses and classes in the creation of various softwares. These products would skillfully replicate the fonts found on paper documents, and the typical feel of simply writing a book.
