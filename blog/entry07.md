# Entry 7: Presentations; In-Class & Elevator Styled

## Content:
Well, this is it. Not only is this the last blog of the school year, but the creation of this also highlights that all of our work is in a sense, basically completed. Now that the [Final Website](https://briannap6399.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/final-project/index.html) was created, and with the SEP Expo, a day where students all across SEP Display their course long project for not only judges, but also teachers and staff to see, officially happening on **May 29th**, all that was left to do was create our presentations. These presentations were made to not only demonstrate and talk more personally about our website, but they were also made in order to develop what's arguably one of the most important skills in our lives; Public Speaking. As my teacher said: [*'This course will teach you how to give presentations, and stand in front of an audience, like I do everyday.'*](https://github.com/bmuellerhstat) Going into the creation of my presentations, I was admittedly a little anxious to talk about how much I struggled with forming the structure of the website, however, I also felt a bit of excitement, since the creation, and eventual sharing, would allow my fellow students to get to know what I created. We had about 3-5 Days to construct a 3-10 Minute long Presentation which as said previously, would be shared to other students, but after that, we also had to create an ['Elevator Pitch',](https://careerdevelopment.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf1041/files/media/elevator_pitch.pdf) which would directly be used for the SEP Expo. Because of how many presentations needed to be made, and how quickly the Expo was coming up, the pressure was on, and I was trying to ensure that I still remained on top. Would I say I managed to remain on top? To say the least, my answer is a bit complicated.
## Presentations Overview + EDP Update:
Since we had to work on the presentation that needed to be more personal first, my classmates and I were pushed into a position where we had to look over our websites as a whole, and the processes behind them; Specifically, we needed to talk about what went into making it, what struggles we had, and of course, what were our own takeaways from the experience. Based on that idea, I decided to bring up a few concepts; My thought Process behind my topic (how I chose it over Education and Photography), and my struggles, which allowed me to bring up what I call the 'Carousel Strand', which I brought up in the 6th Blog. Below this miniature paragraph is the front cover of my In-Class presentation, and upon clicking it, you should be sent to the actual presentation itself (There might not be a lot on the slides, but that's because I wanted the presentation to be mostly verbal):

When I was presenting this publicly, I had received a lot of positive feedback, with some being as simple as my slides look well designed, all the way to my presence in front of the class was what should be seen during a presentation. That's not to say I didn't get any critique however; One comment that especially stook out to me was how it felt like I was selling *T.I.P.S* (My future innovation for Writing) more than my actual website. Looking back now, I can see where that comment comes from; Admittedly, I was, and still kind of am, confused on what the 'Product' part of the presentation should be, as both the website, and my future invention itself were products. I got similar feedback on my Elevator Pitch as well, which is basically a much shorter presentation compared to the In-Class one, which once again, there will be an image below this mini paragraph that shows the draft of it:

My main goal with the Elevator Pitch was to make my 2 Products flow more smoothly together, and show how 1, (My Website) ended up impacting my future invention (T.I.P.S). However, I am able to see that I did favor one idea more than the other with this presentation as well, which leads me to the conclusion that I should work on balancing out my points whenever I present in the future. Due to this, and of course my progression through the course as a whole, I'd say I'm now on the last step of the **E**ngineering **D**esign **P**rocess (EDP), which simply states *'Communicate the Results'*. I do have to be honest, as I believe I was a little confused with the EDP, so that is my mistake, but I am glad that everything was able to still flow as necessary.
## Skills Development:
Good News! I can finally make different sections for each skill, as not only is there a lot for me to bring up about each of my 3 skills, but I also feel like I have more positive opinions about them than I normally would. Might be because this part of the SEP Course was one of the most important in my life, but I'm still grateful. So with that said, let's go in Alphabetical Order, starting with ***Advanced Researching***. 
### Advanced Researching:
Considering what's been done, the presentations, I believe I've done well in this aspect. For some additional details however, I did do some background research on how to act during a presentation, and thanks to those research attempts, I've compiled a list of tips for not just myself when I do more presentations, but for anyone else who will eventually be in the same boat as me:

 1) ***Confidence is key;*** *Make sure you feel confident with what you want to say. Maintain eye-contact with your audience, try not to stutter or read off of your slides.*
 2) ***Get to know your audience;*** *Are you talking to Children? Elderly? A certain demographic, or a mix of all demographics? Identify who you're addressing, and change your presentation accordingly.*
 3) ***Stem from your presentation;*** *Most of the time, the audience won't be drawn to your slides, but instead you. Talk about your topic, but also talk about information that isn't on your slides.*
 4) ***Questions, Questions, Questions;*** *Make sure you comprehend your topic, and to demonstrate that knowledge, take questions from your audience. People like a speaker who demonstrates how passionate they are about their topic.*

There is honestly more advice I could give, but I feel like these 4 are arguably the most important I can give, and since I already know I'll have to do something similar to this style of presentations next year, I'll especially be keeping my own advice in mind.
### Flexibility:
While I'd say this skill has the least amount of development, significant progress was in fact made, which in of itself is a net positive. While working on my Elevator Pitch, I tried to adapt and adjust what I wanted to say in regards to the comment I had received from my teacher. I also wanted to make sure both of my products got some time in the spotlight respectively. So because of that, I tried to lean a bit more on the website; Sure I still brought up T.I.P.S, but I only brought it up for the introduction, before segwaying into my website. While it might've still felt unbalanced to an outside person, I'd definitely say it was an improvement. 
### Time-Management:
In all honesty, there's a lot I'd want to say about this skill. As we were putting together these presentations, I was also left stuck with packing, as my family and I were moving into a bigger space. This meant I had to juggle my time working on packing and working on my presentations, and I think I did a lot better than I expected. For this, I decided to spend the first hour or 2 working on homework and the presentations, before immediately shifting gears towards the packing process. As of me updating this, we are nearly settled into our new apartment, and going off of the praise I've received for both the In-Class Presentation, and of course the Elevator Pitch, I believe this was not only successful, but the biggest success I've achieved during my skills development.
## Final Thoughts: 
This year has genuinely gone by super quickly. I remember being at the beginning of SEP, re-learning basic HTML and CSS, but now I'm officially here, with my developed website, and writing this final blog. I'm going to miss this part of my life for sure, but I'm also hopeful. SEP has helped me regrow my once gigantic interest in Computer Science, which stemmed all the way from Elementary School mind you (Thanks Mr. Kwai), and now that I'm surrounded by like-minded individuals, I am more than prepared for whatever SEP11 will throw my way, and from what I've heard, we'll be covering more Javascript and maybe I'll be able to combine it with some HTML and CSS to make a program similar to [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/). I hope so, but whatever the case, bring on the next boulders, for I won't get knocked back, even if the ground becomes shaky. Thank you reader for sticking with me throughout these past few months, and I hope you have an excellent day!
