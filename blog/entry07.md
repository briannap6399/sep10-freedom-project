Well, this is it. Not only is this the last blog of the school year, but the creation of this also highlights that all of our work is in a sense, basically completed. Now that the [Final Website](https://briannap6399.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/final-project/index.html) was created, and with the SEP Expo, a day where students all across SEP Display their course long project for not only judges, but also teachers and staff to see, officially happening on **May 29th**, all that was left to do was create our presentations. These presentations were made to not only demonstrate and talk more personally about our website, but they were also made in order to develop what's arguably one of the most important skills in our lives; Public Speaking. As my teacher said: [*'This course will teach you how to give presentations, and stand in front of an audience, like I do everyday.'*](https://github.com/bmuellerhstat) Going into the creation of my presentations, I was admittedly a little anxious to talk about how much I struggled with forming the structure of the website, however, I also felt a bit of excitment, since the creation, and eventual sharing, would allow my fellow students to get to know what I created. We had about 3-5 Days to construct a 3-10 Minute long Presentation which as said previously, would be shared to other students, but after that, we also had to create an ['Elevator Pitch',](https://careerdevelopment.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf1041/files/media/elevator_pitch.pdf) which would directly be used for the SEP Expo. Because of how many presentations needed to be made, and how quickly the Expo was coming up, the pressure was on, and I was trying to ensure that I still remained on top. Would I say I managed to remain on top? To say the least, my answer is a bit complicated.
