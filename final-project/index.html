             <p class="support container">As clearly identified in history, communication has been the key to social interactions and collaborations. It’s also been the root of various relationships, romantic or not. Yet, none of these communications would have truly been done without the aid of writing systems. It might not seem like it immediately, but imagine this: Without writing tablets, and utensils, we wouldn’t have any information on more ancient events, nor would we have social media, as texting involves.. Writing. With that said, it begs the question; Why aren't we, as a society, exploring this whole world of writing that we created? Why did we create such a big gift, only to not use it as much as we truly should? Many teens nowadays only look to writing for texting along their social groups, and even then, there has been a whole other alphabet for communicating via social media. There is so much we can use, yet we don’t use it. There’s been various innovations and inventions that are here to aid in writing, and maybe, just maybe, they will be widely used in the near future.</p>

                 <p class="support"> The Phoenician Abjad is what inspired most writing languages to date. It’s believed that writing was invented by the Sumerians, who were in Mesopotamia. Things like the typewriter, and alphasmart, have been proven to be well used for those who don’t want to focus on social media, while also trying to write something. Kobowriter happens to be an open-source project, funded by github, that allows for an e-reader to accept a keyboard, and to be used easily for writing. It’s believed that more expensive models of specific models tend to take more time to set up, and in turn, become too powerful for basic computers to withstand. This is why people encourage the usage of iPads, which happen to be more functional. The Pros of Older Technology (Ones with not much of a link to modern day social media) include more durability, quick start up time, constant energy with only batteries, and quick and easy keyboard shortcuts.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="support col-md-12">The Cons of Older Technology include awkward screening, complications with sending files to more modern based technology, no backlight, and the lack of older technology being made today. Even with older technology, things such as Markdown could be used on a quickpad, for example. There are various cons for the desktop, when it comes to considering whether a desktop computer, laptop, or a smaller writing source is a more viable source. These cons include worse portability, and sometimes complicated to build. The cons for laptops include not being able to connect to other sources properly, and being too limited with expandability. The only possible con for the hand-held hardwares could be the fact that it might be too small to be held and used properly. Tokens were used as the initial writing device, where they commonly took the shapes of circles, or cones. Used to keep track of goods/trades. Other Writing Developments include Graphite Pencils, Early variations of Fountain Pens, Shorthand, and Portable Writing Devices. Graphite Pencils, which were originally Black-Lead Pencils, were firstly created as a tool for artists to sketch. Logograms were used as a means of communication around 3000 BC. They were signs of words, depicted in a specific language. The Alphabet was created around 1500 BC, with Lebanon presumably being the first to use a past variation of it. The earliest printed books required scribes and owners to finish them by adding large and detailed capitals and other navigational aids, including page numbers. The size of the margins and the space between lines was also calculated, as it was in medieval manuscripts.</p>
