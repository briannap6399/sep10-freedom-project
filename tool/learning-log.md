## Tool: **Animate CSS**

---

### Date 3/7/25:
#### I had discovered how to Repeat & Speed-Up/Slow Down Animations.

I started my journey by looking through the main webpage of [Animate CSS](https://animate.style/), before scrolling down to the tabs about **Utility Classes.** I then noticed the base CSS for the **Slower, Slow, Fast & Faster Classes**, and I got curious about them, because I think they could work well with my main idea for my final website. I decided to test the classes, mainly by going to [My Animate CSS Tinkering File](animate-css-tinkering.html) and considering what would have happened if I were to use it on a sample of HTML, as presented here:

```HTML
<style>
h1 {
  color: purple;
  display: inline-block;
}
</style>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css"/>
</head>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce animate__repeat-3 animate__fast">Presto! One Animated object.</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
